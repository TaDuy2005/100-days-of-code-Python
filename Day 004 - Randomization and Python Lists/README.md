# 📅 Day 4 – Randomisation and Python Lists

## 🎓 Course Metadata
- **Course:** 100 Days of Code Python  
- **Difficulty:** ⭐ Beginner  

## 📌 Overview
Day 4 introduced randomness and list data structures in Python. The focus was on importing modules, generating random values, working with lists, and combining these concepts to build a simple interactive game.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Importing modules and using aliases  
- Generating random numbers and random selections  
- Creating and manipulating Python lists  
- Accessing, updating, slicing, and nesting lists  
- Splitting strings into lists for basic data processing  

## 🛠️ Functions & Features Practiced
- `import`, `from ... import`  
- `random.randint()`  
- `random.random()`  
- `random.choice()`  
- `list.append()`  
- `list.extend()`  
- List indexing and slicing  
- Nested lists  
- `str.split()`  

## 🎯 Project of the Day
### ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors
A console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using Python lists and the `random` module.

**Highlights:**
- Stores ASCII art representations in a list  
- Uses random number generation for computer choices  
- Applies conditional logic to determine game outcomes  
- Handles invalid user input gracefully  

This project reinforces list indexing, randomness, and basic game logic using conditionals.

## ✅ Outcomes
- Gained confidence using the `random` module for simple games  
- Learned how to structure and manipulate lists effectively  
- Practiced combining user input, lists, and control flow  
- Built a complete mini-project applying multiple new concepts together
