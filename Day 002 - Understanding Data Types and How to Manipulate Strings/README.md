# 📅 Day 2 – Understanding Data Types and String Manipulation

**Course:** 100 Days of Code – Python  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ Beginner  


---

## 📌 Overview
Day 2 focuses on **Python data types and basic data manipulation**, including numbers, strings, type conversion, and formatting output. These concepts are essential for performing calculations and building interactive programs.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Core Python data types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- String indexing and concatenation
- Using the `type()` function to inspect data types
- Converting between data types
- Mathematical operators and operator precedence
- Rounding numbers with `round()`
- Assignment operators
- Formatting output using f-strings

---

## 🛠️ Functions / Features Practiced
- `type()`
- `str()`, `int()`, `float()`
- `round()`
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)
- f-strings for dynamic string formatting

---

## 🎯 Project of the Day
### 🧮 Tip Calculator
A simple program that:
- Takes bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people
- Performs type conversion and calculations
- Outputs the final amount per person using formatted strings

This project reinforces numeric operations, type conversion, and clean output formatting.

## ✅ Outcome / What I Can Do Now
By the end of Day 2, I can:
- Correctly use and convert between Python data types
- Perform arithmetic operations with precision
- Format dynamic output using f-strings
- Build small calculation-based Python programs
