# 📅 Day 6: Python Functions & Karel

## 🎓 Course Metadata
- **Course:** 100 Days of Code Python  
- **Difficulty:** ⭐

## 📌 Overview
Day 6 focused on writing reusable code with functions and controlling program flow using `while` loops. These concepts were applied in a logic-based environment using Karel to navigate and solve a maze, reinforcing problem-solving through structured thinking.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and return values
- Writing clean, reusable code
- Using `while` loops for condition-based repetition
- Applying logical conditions to control movement
- Combining functions and loops to solve problems

## 🛠️ Functions & Features Practiced
- `def` keyword for function definitions
- Functions with and without parameters
- `return` statements
- `while` loops with Boolean conditions
- Infinite loops with `while True`
- `break` for loop control
- Custom helper functions (`turn_right()`)

## 🎯 Project of the Day

### 🧩 Escaping the Maze
A maze-solving challenge using Karel, where movement decisions are made based on the surrounding environment.

**Highlights:**
- Created helper functions to reduce code repetition
- Used `while` loops to keep Karel moving until the goal was reached
- Applied conditional logic to check walls and paths
- Implemented a right-hand rule strategy to escape the maze

This project reinforces logical thinking, loop control, and function-based problem decomposition.

## ✅ Outcomes
- Built confidence writing and using functions effectively
- Learned when to use `while` loops instead of `for` loops
- Improved ability to reason about conditions and control flow
- Applied Python fundamentals to solve a visual, logic-driven challenge
