# 📅 Day 3 – Control Flow and Logical Operators
- **Course:** 100 Days of Code – Python  
- **Difficulty:** ⭐ Beginner  

---

## 📌 Overview
Day 3 introduces **control flow in Python**, focusing on decision-making using conditional statements and logical operators. These concepts enable programs to respond dynamically to user input and different conditions.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`)
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Nested conditionals and multiple `if` statements
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Counting occurrences with `count()`
- Normalizing user input using `lower()`

---

## 🛠️ Functions / Features Practiced
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- `count()` for strings and lists
- `lower()` for case-insensitive comparisons
- Handling user input with branching logic

---

## 🎯 Project of the Day
### Treasure Island
A text-based adventure game where:
- The user navigates choices using typed input
- Game outcomes depend on conditional logic
- Nested decisions determine win or game-over states

This project reinforces control flow, logical operators, and input handling.

---

## ✅ Outcome / What I Can Do Now
By the end of Day 3, I can:
- Build programs that make decisions based on conditions
- Combine multiple conditions using logical operators
- Write nested and structured control flows
- Create interactive, choice-based Python applications
