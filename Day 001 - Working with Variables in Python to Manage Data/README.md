**Course:** 100 Days of Code – Python  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ Beginner  

---

## 📌 Overview
Day 1 focuses on the **fundamentals of Python programming**, including how to display output, take user input, work with variables, and understand common beginner errors. This day builds the foundation for all future Python projects.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Using the `print()` function and its parameters
- Creating new lines with `\n`
- String manipulation and concatenation
- Taking user input with `input()`
- Writing comments in Python
- Declaring and updating variables
- Variable naming conventions
- Using the `len()` function
- Understanding common errors:

## 🛠️ Functions & Features Practiced
- `print()`
- `input()`
- `len()`
- String concatenation (`+`)
- Escape characters (`\n`)
- Comments (`#`)

## 🎯 Project of the Day
### 🎸 Band Name Generator
A simple interactive program that:
- Greets the user
- Takes city and pet name as input
- Combines inputs to generate a band name

This project reinforces:
- User input
- String concatenation
- Output formatting
