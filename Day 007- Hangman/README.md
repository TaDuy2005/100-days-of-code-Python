# 📅 Day 7: Hangman

## 🎓 Course Metadata
- **Course:** 100 Days of Code Python  
- **Difficulty:** ⭐

## 📌 Overview
Day 7 centered on building a complete word-guessing game using conditional logic and lists. The focus was on checking values within lists, combining list elements into strings, and managing game state through loops and conditions.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Joining list elements into strings
- Checking membership with `in` and `not in`
- Conditional logic for game flow
- Updating lists dynamically during execution
- Tracking user guesses and remaining lives

## 🛠️ Functions & Features Practiced
- `str.join()`
- `if value in list` / `if value not in list`
- List initialization and updates
- `while` loops for continuous gameplay
- Conditional statements for win/lose logic
- `random.choice()`

## 🎯 Project of the Day

### 🎮 Hangman
A fully interactive command-line Hangman game where the player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word.

**Highlights:**
- Randomly selected words from a predefined list
- Used lists to track correct guesses and placeholders
- Implemented life tracking and visual game stages
- Prevented repeated guesses with list checks
- Determined win/lose conditions dynamically

This project reinforces list operations, conditional statements, and string manipulation in a real game scenario.

## ✅ Outcomes
- Improved confidence using lists for state management
- Learned to combine list data into readable output with `join()`
- Practiced conditional checks with `in` and `not in`
- Built a complete game loop with clear win and lose conditions
- Strengthened problem-solving skills through a larger mini-project
