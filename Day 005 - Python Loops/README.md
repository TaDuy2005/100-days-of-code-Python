# 📅 Day 5: Python Loops

## 🎓 Course Metadata
- **Course:** 100 Days of Code Python  
- **Difficulty:** ⭐

## 📌 Overview
Day 5 introduced looping constructs in Python, focusing on `for` loops, the `range()` function, and list manipulation during iteration. These concepts are foundational for automating repetitive tasks, processing collections, and building logic-driven programs.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Iterating over sequences with `for` loops
- Using `_` as a throwaway loop variable
- Generating number sequences with `range()`
- Removing elements from lists safely
- Combining loops with randomization for real-world tasks

## 🛠️ Functions & Features Practiced
- `for variable in iterable`
- `_` as an unused loop variable
- `range(start, stop, step)`
- `list.remove(value)`
- `random.choice()`
- Looping with counters and list indices

## 🎯 Project of the Day

### 🔐 Password Generator
A terminal-based password generator that creates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria.

**Highlights:**
- Used `for` loops to control character generation
- Combined letters, numbers, and symbols dynamically
- Implemented both ordered and randomized password logic
- Practiced list manipulation and removal during iteration

This project reinforces loop control, randomness, and list operations in a practical security-focused application.

## ✅ Outcomes
- Gained a solid understanding of `for` loops and iteration patterns
- Learned when and why to use `_` in loops
- Practiced generating numeric sequences with `range()`
- Improved confidence manipulating lists during loops
- Built a functional password generator using core Python concepts
